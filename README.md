Self healing infrastructure as network. A lot people able to communicate without having to jump on the web which might be down.  

As an open source project, a fantastic way to teach electronics. Many people are afraid of electronics but an open source version of this would be empowering, educational. We have this idea, but how to get the kids to do it. We are creating prototypes with a lesson that teaches how to bring this to the classroom.

The open source aspect of the project accomplishes these lessons and the sharing of knowledge. A hands on way to learn about electricity, tying it in to computer classes and learning how to program.

We are here to build the platform, people can take this to run with it.
